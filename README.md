## 1. Setup

### Installing software
This repository is built using a combination of TensorFlow and PyTorch. You can install the necessary libraries by pip installing the requirements text file `pip install -r ./requirements_tf.txt` and `pip install -r ./requirements_pytorch.txt`

## 2. Usage
### Toy experiment
[toy_script.py](toy_script.py) is the script for running toy dataset experiment. You can analyze the training/testing data at diffferent stages of the training, viz. Early, Middle, and Late, using the flags `split` and `mode`. The `vog_cal` flag enables visualizing different versions of VOG scores such as the raw score, class normalized, or the absolute class normalized scores. 

#### Examples
Running `python3 toy_script.py --split test --mode early --vog_cal normalize` generates the toy dataset decision boundary figure along with the relation between the perpendicular distance of individual points from the decision boundary and the VOG scores. The respective figures are:

Right: The scatter plot between the Variance of Gradients (VoGs) for each testing data point and their perpendicular distance shows that higher scores pertain to the most
challenging examples (closest to the decision boundary)</i></p>

### ImageNet
The main scripts for the ImageNet experiments are in the `./imagenet/` folder. 

1. Before calculating the VOG scores you would need to store the gradients of the respective images in the `./scripts/train.txt/` file using model snapshots. For demonstration purpose, we have shared the model weights of the [late stage](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_dY4H_dizvTGUkQFAQANfFRDc_82Bsli?usp=sharing), i.e. steps 30024, 31275, and 32000. Now, for example, we want to store the gradients for the imagenet dataset (stored as <path>/imagenet_dir/train) at snapshot `32000`, we run the shell script [train_get_gradients.sh](train_get_gradients.sh) like:
    
`source train_get_gradients.sh 32000 ./imagenet/train_results/ 9 ./scripts/train.txt/`

2. For this repo, we have generated the gradients for 100 random images for the late stage training process and stored the results in `./imagenet/train_results/`. To generate the error rate performance at different VOG deciles run [train_visualize_grad.py](train_visualize_grad.py) using the following command.
`python train_visualize_grad.py`

</p>

On analyzing the VOG score for a particular class (e.g. below are `magpie` and `pop bottle`) in the late training stage, we found two unique groups of images.
In this work, we hypothesize that examples that a model has difficulty learning (images on the right) will exhibit higher variance in gradient updates over the course of training (. On the
other hand, the gradient updates for the relatively easier examples are expected to stabilize early in training and converge to a narrow range of values.
